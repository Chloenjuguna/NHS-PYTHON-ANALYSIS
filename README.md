# NHS-PYTHON-ANALYSIS

### Background:
 The NHS is focused on optimising healthcare infrastructure to meet growing population needs. Analysing utilisation trends is crucial for informed decision making on budget allocation, capacity expansion, or maximising existing resources. Stakeholder opinions on budget allocation vary, promoting the need for data exploration and recommendations. With a wealth of information and numerous questions, distilling concerns into four concise problem statements is essential for effective data exploration.
Problem statements:
1. There is a lack of clarity on patient engagement in practices across England.
2. There is uncertainty about the proportion of patients actually attending their
appointments.
3. There is ambiguity surrounding appointment types, the type of professionals
available, and service settings.
4. There is no clear strategy for using external sources (X) to find popular hashtags,
which may help improve public health communication and increase patient engagement.

### Data Sources:
1. actual_duration.csv
2. appointment_regional.csv
3. national_cateogries.xlsx
4. tweets.csv
5. metadata_nhs.txt – metadata of the above CSV files combined.

### Tools:
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)

### Data analysis:
Please see attached file containing my Python Notebook.[Link here](https://github.com/Chloenjuguna/NHS-PYTHON-ANALYSIS/blob/main/NHS_Analysis.ipynb)

### Recommendations following analysis:
1. Standardised Data Entry practices: implement national standards for data entry across practice systems to enhance uniformity and reduce bias in data quality. Investment in a unified system can streamline data collection, for future exploration.
2. Training Programs: provide training on data entry protocols to healthcare staff, promoting accurate recording of appointment information and improving overall data accuracy.
3. Social Media Engagement: utilise social media platforms, such as (X) , to circulate information about the impact of missed appointments. This could look like creating awareness campaigns using engaging hashtags to discourage non-attendance.
4. Promotion of alternative appointment modes: encourage patients to book video/online appointments through social media promotion catering to those who are unable to attend physically, which may reduce the amount of missed appointments.
5. Budget allocation: Focus budget allocation on maximising existing infrastructure and resources within the NHS, ensuring more efficient healthcare delivery.
6. Observed appointment utilisation figures range from approximately 533,596 to 1,013,502. You may want to consider adjusting resources and staffing based on monthly variations to optimise efficiency to ensure that the NHS operates within or close to its planned capacity of 1,200, 000 appointments per day.

These recommendations aim to address data quality issues, enhance patient engagement, increase the system’s responsiveness to varying demand levels and optimising resource allocation toward current infrastructure to help improve healthcare outcomes.
